# Nate's Python Toolset
This is a list of tools that I've written in python for things like automation, comparisons, or quick things that I needed in the moment and thought would be fun to program myself instead of finding an alternative.

> [!NOTE]
> Each tool has it's own `readme.md` as a guide for how to use it as well as information through the command line with the -h parameter.

## Contents
- CSV Diff: A diffing tool for csv files that can either create a literal diff or an entry diff (like an OUTER join in SQL, you only get the entries that exist in one or the other, not both).
